# DD1337 Week 2

## Getting started

### Install Rust

1) Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2) _If you're running Windows_, install [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
3) Install the Rust build tool and package manager [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Alternativly, _if you're developing in Visual Studio Code_, install the [Rust support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust).

### Prepare for your assigment

Your first assignments are turned in by uploading them to a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-2` under the `INDAPlus20` organisation. Be careful to get the spelling right.

The grade to an assigment is left in the form of an issue with "Pass", "Komplettering", or "Fail" in the title. In case of "Komplettering", read the instructions on what to adjust down in the issue description. Leave a comment on the issue upon reupload of the assignment. "Pass" and "Fail" are self explanatory. 

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-2`.
2) Clone your newly created repository.
`git clone git@github.com:INDAPlus20/<KTH_ID>-task-2.git`
3) Create one Rust crate (term for application or library) per subassignment. 

#### How to create a Rust application (_binary_) crate

1) Navigate in your terminal or command prompt to `<KTH_ID>-task-2`.
2) Create a new directory with an appropriate name.
3) Navigate into your newly created root directory.
4) Initialise your Rust crate.
`cargo init`
5) Build and run your application.
`cargo run`

Your clean build looks like:
```
appropriate_name
|- Cargo.lock
|- Cargo.toml
|- src
  |- main.rs
|- target
```

Write your source code in `src`, where the `main` function is located in `src/main.rs`. To make it easier, begin by copying the contents of `./kattis_template/src/main.rs` into your `main.rs` file.

## Assignment

### Kattis problems

This week, you're going to learn the basics of Rust by solving [Kattis](https://kth.kattis.com) problems. For each problem, create one Rust crate in `<KTH_ID>_assignments/week_2`. Include a screenshot of your Kattis submission to prove solution. See `./minimal_scalar_product` for a Kattis solution example.

Solve at least two of the following problems:
- [Summera tal](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.javap.sumsort)
- [Avstånd till kanten](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.javap.kant)
- [Cyber-Clara och anmälningslistorna](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.grupdat.anmalningslistorna)
- [A Different Problem](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/different)

_(optional challenge)_ A example solution to the Kattis problem [Minimal Scalar Product](https://open.kattis.com/problems/minimumscalar) can be found in `./minimal_scalar_product`. This solution runs at 0.06s. See the [statistics](https://open.kattis.com/problems/minimumscalar/statistics) for the Rust language. As you can see, it's possible to solve this problem in much less time. Write your own solution, which may be based on the example solution, and which runs quicker than 0.06s.

### Questions

#### Method chaining

Observe the following code:

```rust
let input = io::stdin();

let mut lines = input
    .lock()
    .lines()
    .map(|_line| _line.ok().unwrap().to_string());

// for every line, assuming input strings with the characters '0' and '1' seperated by whitelines

let binary_line = lines
    .next().unwrap()
    .split(" ")
    .map(|_title| {
        _title
            .chars()
            .map(|_character| {
                match _character {
                    '0' => false,
                    _ => true
                }
            })
            .collect::<Vec<bool>>()
    })
    .collect::<Vec<Vec<bool>>>();
```

Know the answer of the following question:
- What is the value of `binary_line`?

#### Iterables

Observe the following code:

```rust
use std::collections::{ HashMap, HashSet };

/*...*/

let limit: usize = 10;

let mut index_store: HashMap<usize, usize> = HashMap::with_capacity(limit + 1);
let mut value_store: Vec<HashSet<usize>> = Vec::with_capacity(limit + 1);
        
for _value in 1..(limit + 1) {
    index_store.insert(_value, _value - 1);

    let mut sequence: HashSet<usize> = HashSet::new();
    sequence.insert(_value);

    value_store.push(sequence);
}
```

Know the answer of the following questions:
- What is the value of `index_store`?
- What is the value of `value_store`?
